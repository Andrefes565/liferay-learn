With any new feature or upgrade of a system, it is ideal that a battery of tests are ran to check that no functionality is broken by the new code. With a constantly evolving platform like Liferay DXP, manual test executions can quickly become unsustainable because of time and cost constraints. A more realistic means to continuously test your implementation is through automated testing.
