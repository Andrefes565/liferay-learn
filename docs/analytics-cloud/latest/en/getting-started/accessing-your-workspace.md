# Accessing Your Workspace

After setting up your [multi-factor authentication](./multi-factor-authentication.md), a list of workspaces that you belong to, or can request access to appears. If you do not see a workspace, please make sure the workspace administrator already added you to a workspace, or you can [sign up for a new workspace](./signing-up-for-a-new-workspace.md).

Workspaces that have the **Configuration Required** label require the *Workspace Owner* to click through and fill out the appropriate configurations in order for the workspace to function and be accessible.

Additional workspaces may be accessible if your login email address maps to a workspaces **Allowed Email Domains**. These workspaces will be listed at the bottom section. Clicking on the *Request Access* button sends a request to the *Workspace Admin*. Once approved by the *Workspace Admin*, you can start using the workspace as well.

Click on any workspace that you have access to will directly take you to the home of your Analytics Cloud workspace.

## Onboarding Process

If this is a new workspace, you will see an onboarding guide upon entering for the first time. The guide will help you connect Analytics Cloud to your Liferay DXP instance.

After successful connection, invite other people to have access to your new workspace.
