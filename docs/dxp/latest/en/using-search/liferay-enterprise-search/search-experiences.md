> **Liferay Enterprise Search (LES) Subscribers**

The Liferay Enterprise Search Experiences app includes a suite of features granting fine-grained control over the end user's search experience. As the search administrator you can use Search Experiences for search customizations varying in complexity:

- Make minor tweaks to Liferay's default search page behavior
- Override the search page behavior completely
- Configure context-aware search results based on attributes of the search user

## Search Blueprints

Search Blueprints is the first feature in the Search Experiences application. To learn about it's capabilities and fundamental components, see

- [Understanding Blueprints](search-experiences/understanding-search-blueprints.md)
- [Creating and Managing Search Blueprints](search-experiences/creating-and-managing-search-blueprints.md)
