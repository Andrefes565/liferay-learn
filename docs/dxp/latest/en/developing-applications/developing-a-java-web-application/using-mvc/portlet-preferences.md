# Portlet Preferences

Portlet preferences allow users to configure a preference for an individual portlet. Portlet preferences can be added to any MVC Portlet so that users can have a UI to access and set their preferences.

Note, portlet preferences are stored properties that are separate from an application's configuration. To learn more see [Portlet Level Configuration](../../core-frameworks/configurable-application/portlet-level-configuration.md)
