# Definitions for Event Attributes

Different attributes are associated with default and custom events. Global attributes are attributes that are collected for all types of events. Other attributes are specific to different types of events. To view and manage event attributes, navigate to *Settings* &rarr; *Workspace Data* &rarr; *Definitions* &rarr; *Event Attributes*.

1. Choose a specific attribute under the Global Attributes tab or the Attributes tab. Use the search bar to find a particular attribute.
