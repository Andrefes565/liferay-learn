# Creating and Managing Blueprints

To create Search Blueprints,

1. Open the Blueprints application by clicking _Blueprints_ in the Global Menu &rarr; Applications.

1. Give the Blueprint a name (required) and a description (optional).

1. Decide whether to start by including all the clauses from Liferay's search framework, or to start with a minimal baseline of clauses to use as the foundation for a more fully customized search experience.

1. Depending on your [blueprint plan](#planning-a-blueprint), next you'll use these menus to continue building the [Blueprint](./understanding-blueprints.md#what-is-a-blueprint):

   - [Query Builder](#using-the-query-builder): add new query clauses to the search by choosing or composing Elements for the Blueprint.
   - [Clause Contributors](#configuring-default-clauses): Further refine which clauses are included from Liferay's Indexers and Keyword Query Contributors. 
   - [Settings](#adding-settings): Configure advanced settings like Aggregations, or Facets, in the search.

1. Preview the Blueprint. Click _Preview_
