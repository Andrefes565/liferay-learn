Poshi
=====

Poshi is a test automation framework that is simple, easy to understand, and does not require prior programming language to get started. It is a tool that allows testers to write tests that simulate a user's behavior as they navigate through a site. It is not JavaScript, rather, Poshi uses a Groovy-like script syntax built on top of [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp), which is one of the most popular open source tools for browser automation.
