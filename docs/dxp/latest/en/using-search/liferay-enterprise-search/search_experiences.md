The Liferay Enterprise Search Experiences app includes a suite of features granting fine-grained control over the end user's search experience. As the search administrator you can use Search Experiences for search customizations varying in complexity:

- Make minor tweaks to Liferay's default search page behavior
- Override the search page behavior completely
- Configure context-aware search results based on attributes of the search user
