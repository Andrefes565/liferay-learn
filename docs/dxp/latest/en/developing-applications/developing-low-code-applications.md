Liferay CE/DXP 7.4 introduces the Objects application for low code development. With it, you can quickly develop solutions without having to write any code or deploy modules. This reduces the learning curve for customizing the Liferay portal to fit your business needs.

```{important}
Liferay CE/DXP 7.3 included the App Builder application for low code development. However, it has been deprecated and removed from 7.4. <!--TASK: link to data migration article when finished.-->
