# Account Roles

Like [regular roles](../roles-and-permissions/understanding-roles-and-permissions.md) in DXP, [Accounts](../accounts.md) have Account Roles that give different permissions for different roles. Assign specific account roles to your Account Users based on your business needs.

## Viewing Account Roles

There are two categories of Account Roles: instance wide roles and Account specific roles. Instance wide roles are Account Roles that are available across all Accounts in a DXP Instance. Account specific roles are roles that are created and managed for a specific Account.

### View Instance Wide Account Roles

To view an instance wide role, 

1. Open the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)). Navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Roles*.

1. Click the *Account Roles* tab and view the list of available roles.

### View Account Specific Account Roles

To view an Account specific role,

1. Open the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)). Navigate to *Applications* &rarr; *Accounts*.

1. Click on the specific Account you wish to view. Click the *Roles* tab and view the list of available roles.
