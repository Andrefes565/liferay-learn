# Creating a Virtual Product

A Virtual Product is a non-tangible product that can be downloaded. This can be a music file, a video, an electronic publication or even a warranty or a service contract. In some cases, a Virtual Product may be defined by a set duration or maximum number of downloads that determines its validity. As with other Products, their inventory is tracked and may be sold individually or as part of a Grouped Product.

## Create a Virtual Product

The following steps will walk you through the creation of a Virtual Product:

1. Open the *Global Menu*, click on the *Commerce* tab, and go to *Product Management* &rarr; *Products*.
1. Click the Add button(![Add icon](../../../images/icon-add.png)), and select _Virtual_.
1. Enter a *name* and select the desired *Catalog*.
1. Click _Submit_ when finished.

Once this Virtual Product has been created, store administrators need to associate the digital assets and terms of use with the product.

## Set Virtual Product Details

1. Click the _Virtual_ sub-tab to continue.

   ![The Virtual sub-tab is used to configure the Virtual Product.](./creating-a-virtual-product/images/01.png)

For more information about each field, see the [Virtual Product Reference](./virtual-product-reference.md) article.

```{note}
The Activation Status associated with a Virtual Product determines the stage at which it will become available to download. For example, if it is set to Completed, the product will be available to download once the Order is completed. 
```

## Apply Product Options

You can apply [Product Options](../products/using-product-options.md) to a Virtual Product. For example, an e-book might have alternate front covers depending on different markets.

Click the _Options_ sub-tab to select an existing template or create a new one.

## Set Prices and Quantities

To set product prices and quantities:

1. Click the _SKUs_ sub-tab.
1. Click the _3-dot_ icon &rarr; _Edit_, for the _default_ SKU.
1. The _Pricing_ section has one entry each for base price, sale price and cost. A sale price of 0 indicates no promotions or discounts. The cost price is not visible to the buyers and can be used by suppliers to calculate their margin.
1. To add the product to any of the existing [Price Lists](../../managing-prices/adding-products-to-a-price-list.md), click the _Price List_ sub-tab.
1. To set inventory, click the _Inventory_ sub-tab and set the appropriate quantities in each warehouse. Click the _Save_ button for every warehouse that is updated.

## Add Product Specifications

[Product specifications](../products/specifications.md) contain useful pieces of product information, such as dimensions, color, weight, capacity, or almost any other attribute. Click the _Specifications_ sub-tab to add specifications.

## Upload Product Images and Attachments

[Product images](../products/product-images.md) help to ensure that customers know what they are buying. Each product variant (SKU) can have their own associated product image. Click the _Media_ sub-tab to add all product images.

Store administrators can also add attachments that are associated with a particular product. Click the Add button(![Add icon](../../../images/icon-add.png)) under the _Attachments_ section.

## Organize with Categories

[Product Categories](../products/creating-a-new-product-category.md) are used to organize products. Product categories may be used to apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist buyers in finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified account or account group.

## Associate with Related Products

[Product Relations](../products/related-products-up-sells-and-cross-sells.md) can be used to connect products. Once connected, a product displays the links to other products. Every related product must be assigned to a Product Relation Type.
